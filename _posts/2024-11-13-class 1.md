> Definitions of Key Technologies
>Virtual Reality (VR): A simulated environment where the user experiences a sense of "presence" and embodiment.
>Augmented Reality (AR): Virtual elements are overlaid on top of the real world.
>Mixed Reality (MR): A blend of virtual and real elements, where both interact in real-time.
>Extended Reality (XR): An umbrella term encompassing VR, AR, and MR, including everything from fully real to fully virtual environments.

History and Milestones of VR
```markdown
1945: Vannevar Bush's "MEMEX" concept, a precursor to hypertext and interactive information systems.
1963: Ivan Sutherland's "Sketchpad" and "Sword of Damocles" (first VR system).
1984: Jaron Lanier’s VPL Research, which introduced the term "Virtual Reality."
1992: Carolina Cruz-Neira’s CAVE system, an immersive VR environment.
2012: Oculus Rift, marking a resurgence in consumer VR technology.
```


Key Researchers and Contributions
```markdown
Vannevar Bush: Visionary behind MEMEX, an early concept of augmenting human memory.
Ivan Sutherland: Developed Sketchpad and the concept of "The Ultimate Display" for VR.
Douglas Engelbart: Invented the mouse and contributed to early HCI with the "Mother of All Demos."
Mark Weiser: Introduced Ubiquitous Computing, shaping the future of everyday technologies blending into the environment.
```

Key Concepts in HCI and VR
```markdown
Presence: The feeling of being physically situated in a virtual environment, even though the user is not.
Immersion: The objective measurement of how vivid and enveloping a virtual environment is.
Interaction Techniques: How users interact with virtual or augmented environments using input devices like controllers or motion sensors.
```

Current Trends in VR/AR
```markdown
Major technology companies (Google, Microsoft, Apple) are heavily investing in VR/AR technologies, focusing on user experience.
The transition from early experimental VR to consumer-friendly devices like Oculus Quest.
A focus on content creation tools (e.g., Unity3D) to make VR/AR development more accessible.
