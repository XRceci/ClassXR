##Week 1 - Setting Up Unity for XR 

Our first week was all about getting Unity ready for VR! Here‚Äôs how we did it:

### Installing Unity & Creating a 3D Project 
We started by installing Unity and setting up a brand-new 3D project, the foundation of our VR experience.

### Adding XR Support 

    We jumped into Package Manager and installed the XR Interaction Toolkit to handle VR interactions.

    From the XR Plug-in Management window in Project Settings, we selected Oculus as the platform for Android standalone devices. We also installed the Meta All-in-One package to enable various interactions.

###  Building the VR Rig üé•

    We created a plane (our virtual ground).
    Then, we created an empty GameObject and added an XR Rig component to it. Then, we assigned the appropriate game objects to the Camera Floor Object Offset and the Camera Game Object in the XR Rig. We set the Tracking Origin Mode to ‚ÄúFloor‚Äù to avoid the camera starting at floor level.

### Connecting to Meta Quest üîó
Finally, we linked our Meta Quest headset, hit Play Mode, and BOOM! We were inside our VR world! 

This setup laid the groundwork for our VR interactions, and we were officially ready to start building!
