## Week 1 - Setting Up Unity for XR 

Our first week was all about getting Unity ready for VR! Here’s how we did it:

## Installing Unity & Creating a 3D Project 
We started by installing Unity and setting up a brand-new 3D project, the foundation of our VR experience.

## Adding XR Support 

We jumped into Package Manager and installed the XR Interaction Toolkit to handle VR interactions.

###  Building the VR Rig 🎥

We created a plane (our virtual ground).
Then, we created an empty GameObject and added an XR Rig component to it. Then, we assigned the appropriate game objects to the Camera Floor Object Offset and the Camera Game Object in the XR Rig. We set the Tracking Origin Mode to “Floor” to avoid the camera starting at floor level.

## Connecting to Meta Quest 🔗
Finally, we linked our Meta Quest headset, hit Play Mode, and BOOM! We were inside our VR world! 

This setup laid the groundwork for our VR interactions, and we were officially ready to start building!

## What is FlyRing Selection?

Last week, we proposed two VR selection techniques for a supermarket scenario, and we decided to go with FlyRing Selection—sounds cool, right? This technique is all about creating a fancy yet efficient way to select and inspect items in VR.

![Image 08](https://github.com/XRceci/ClassXR/raw/master/assets/image/250114/08.png)

Here's the idea: use a ray to select a group of items from afar, and they magically fly toward you, forming a circular arrangement around you. You can then rotate the circle to examine each item up close, effortlessly and intuitively. It's like having your own futuristic carousel of products at your fingertips!

Now, it's time to bring FlyRing Selection to life. Let's  make it happen! 🚀



# Implementation

## 1 - First, Let's walk !

We should provide our user with the ability to explore the supermarket to check out what they like, we need to be able to walk!

for that, we can use the left joy stick by getting the input from `PrimaryThumbstick`, where "Primary" is the left hand controller.

the "forward" and "right" directions should depend on where the user is looking, so we get where the camera is pointing at

then we calculate how much the user should move and we apply this transformation to our `cameraRig`'s position depending on the `moveSpeed` that we want .

```C#
    private void HandleMovement() 
    {
        Vector2 joystickInput = OVRInput.Get(OVRInput.Axis2D.PrimaryThumbstick);
        if (joystickInput.magnitude > 0.1f) 
        {
            // Get forward and right directions from the camera
            Vector3 forward = Camera.main.transform.forward;
            Vector3 right = Camera.main.transform.right;
            // Remove vertical component for horizontal-only movement
            forward.y = 0;
            right.y = 0;
            forward.Normalize();
            right.Normalize();
            // Calculate and apply movement
            Vector3 moveDirection = (forward * joystickInput.y + right * joystickInput.x);
            cameraRig.transform.position += moveDirection * moveSpeed * Time.deltaTime;
        }
    }
```

## 2 - Pre-Selection
### 2.1 - Ray casting

Our technique begins by allowing users to point at objects using ray casting from their right controller. First we create a visual representation of the ray using Unity's `LineRenderer`:

```C#
private LineRenderer lineRenderer;
private void Start()
{   
    // Initialize line renderer for visual feedback
    lineRenderer = rightController.GetComponent<LineRenderer>();
    if (lineRenderer == null)
    {
        lineRenderer = rightController.AddComponent<LineRenderer>();
        lineRenderer.startWidth = 0.01f;
        lineRenderer.endWidth = 0.01f;
        lineRenderer.material = new Material(Shader.Find("Unlit/Color"));
        lineRenderer.material.color = Color.red;
    }
}
```

In our `HandleObjectAttraction` method, we continuously update the ray's position and direction:
```C#
// Update visual ray
lineRenderer.SetPosition(0, controllerTransform.position);
lineRenderer.SetPosition(1, controllerTransform.position + controllerTransform.forward * raycastDistance);
```

Since we want to be able to detect even occluded objects, we use 3. we use `Physics.RaycastAll` to detect all objects along the ray:
```C#
RaycastHit[] hits = Physics.RaycastAll(controllerTransform.position, 
                                     controllerTransform.forward, 
                                     raycastDistance);
```

the array `RaycastHit[]` will contain all the objects that has been detected along the ray

      allowfullscreen>
  </iframe>
</div>



### 2.2 - Bringing Objects Closer and make a circle!

Once we've detected all objects along the ray, we need to bring them closer to the user and arrange them in a circle for easier selection. This happens when the user pulls the trigger.

First, we store the original positions of all detected objects so we can return them later:
```C#
foreach (RaycastHit hit in hits)
{
    GameObject hitObject = hit.collider.gameObject;
    if (!activeObjects.Contains(hitObject))
    {
        activeObjects.Add(hitObject);
        if (!originalPositions.ContainsKey(hitObject))
        {
            // Store original position and material
            originalPositions[hitObject] = hitObject.transform.position;
            MeshRenderer renderer = hitObject.GetComponent<MeshRenderer>();
            originalMaterials[hitObject] = renderer.material;
        }
    }
}
```

Then we arrange the objects in a circle, for that we have an `ArrangeObjectsInCircle` method:

```C#
private void ArrangeObjectsInCircle()
{
    Transform controllerTransform = rightController.transform;
    // Calculate the center point of the circle in front of the controller
    Vector3 centerPoint = controllerTransform.position + controllerTransform.forward * circleDistance;
    
    // Calculate angle step for even distribution
    float angleStep = 360f / activeObjects.Count;
    
    // Position each object around the circle
    for (int i = 0; i < activeObjects.Count; i++)
    {
        float angle = i * angleStep * Mathf.Deg2Rad;
        Vector3 targetPosition = centerPoint + new Vector3(
            Mathf.Sin(angle) * circleRadius,  // X position
            0,                                // Keep Y position constant
            Mathf.Cos(angle) * circleRadius   // Z position
        );

        // Smoothly move object to target position
        activeObjects[i].transform.position = Vector3.Lerp(
            activeObjects[i].transform.position,
            targetPosition,
            Time.deltaTime * attractionSpeed
        );
    }
}
```

- `circleDistance`: Controls how far in front of the user the circle appears
- `circleRadius`: Determines the size of the circle
- `attractionSpeed`: Controls how quickly objects move to their positions

Objects are evenly spaced around the circle by calculating `angleStep`, and we use `Vector3.Lerp` to get a smooth movement animation

## 3 - Selection Process

Once all objects are arranged in a circle, it's time for the user to pick their desired item! To make this process smooth and intuitive, we implement three key features:

    1. Highlighting the object the user is pointing at.
    2. Rotating the circle using the right joystick for a better view of product labels.
    3. Confirming selection with the "A" button, making the item drop into the shopping cart.


### 3.1 - Object Highlighting

To help users know which item they are selecting, we highlight the object they are pointing at:
```C#
// Check if pointing at an object
if (Physics.Raycast(controllerTransform.position, controllerTransform.forward, out hit)) {
	GameObject hitObject = hit.collider.gameObject;    
    // Highlight only unselected active objects
    if (activeObjects.Contains(hitObject) && hitObject != selectedObject)
    {
	    pointedObject = hitObject;
	    hitObject.GetComponent<MeshRenderer>().material = highlightMaterial;
    }
}
```

Key Takeaways:

    We use Physics.Raycast (instead of RaycastAll) since all objects are now visible.
    When pointing at an object, we apply a highlight material to give visual feedback.
    When looking away, the object returns to its original material.


3.2 - Rotating the Circle

To help users inspect product labels more closely, we allow them to rotate the item ring using the right joystick:

```C#
private void HandleObjectRotation()
{
    // Prevent rotation if objects are returning or if there are no active objects
    if (isReturning || activeObjects.Count == 0) return;

    // Get joystick input
    Vector2 joystickInput = OVRInput.Get(OVRInput.Axis2D.SecondaryThumbstick);
    
    // Rotate only if input exceeds a small threshold
    if (Mathf.Abs(joystickInput.x) > 0.1f)
    {
        // Adjust rotation angle and rearrange objects
        rotationAngle += joystickInput.x * moveSpeed * Time.deltaTime;
        ArrangeObjectsInCircle();
    }
}
```


Key Takeaways:

    Right joystick (SecondaryThumbstick) controls rotation → Moving left/right rotates the ring for better visibility.
    Prevents accidental movement → Small joystick input is ignored to avoid unwanted rotation.
    Smooth animation → Rotation updates over time for a more natural feel.




3.3 - Selecting and Dropping Items

Once the user finds the perfect item, they press the "A" button to drop it into the shopping cart:
```C#
private void DropObject(GameObject obj)
{
    // Move object to its selection position before applying physics
    obj.transform.position = selectedObjectPosition;
    
    Rigidbody rb = obj.GetComponent<Rigidbody>();
    if (rb == null)
    {
        rb = obj.AddComponent<Rigidbody>(); // Add Rigidbody if missing
    }
   ``` 
    rb.isKinematic = false; // Enable gravity for a natural drop
    isDropping = false; // Mark the drop as completed
}

Key Takeaways:

    Ensures correct position before dropping to avoid glitches.
    Adds physics if necessary, making sure objects fall naturally.
    Smoothly drops the item into the cart, making the selection process feel satisfying.

## 4 - Returning the objects back

When users are done examining the objects and have made their selection (or decided not to select anything), they can press the trigger again to return all objects to their original positions. 

1. **Tracking Return Progress**:
```C#
bool allObjectsReturned = true;
List<GameObject> objectsToRemove = new List<GameObject>();
```
We use `allObjectsReturned` to track if all objects have reached their destinations
and `objectsToRemove` to store objects that have completed their return journey


2. **Arrival Detection**:
Objects that have arrived are marked for removal from active tracking
```C#
if (Vector3.Distance(currentPos, targetPos) < 0.01f)
{
    objectsToRemove.Add(obj);
    obj.transform.position = targetPos; // Ensure exact position
}
else
{
    allObjectsReturned = false;
}
```

3. **Cleanup**:
Then, we remove returned objects from all tracking collections to prevent further updates to objects that have completed their return
```C#
foreach (GameObject obj in objectsToRemove)
{
    activeObjects.Remove(obj);
    originalPositions.Remove(obj);
    originalMaterials.Remove(obj);
}
```
