## Roll-A-Ball -1 

This week, we developed a small VR program using Meta Quest and Unity. Our goal was to build a simple bowling game to test ball interactions in VR. Below are the steps we followed:

### Step 1:Adding Controllers
We added both hand controllers and attached the XR Controller component to them.

### Step 2: Building the Scene
To prototype, we:
- Added a Plane object to the scene.
- Created a cube as a table.
- Added a ball, which could be grasped with the hand controllers.
- Placed some bowling pins, which could be knocked over by the ball.

### Step 3: tep 3: Making Objects Interactive 
To bring our VR world to life, we made objects interactable!
####  Adding Physics 
We attached a Rigidbody to the ball, allowing it to react to gravity and collisions.

####  Enabling VR Interaction üñêÔ∏è
We added the XR Grab Interactable component, so the ball could be picked up and manipulated in VR.

####  Grabbing & Throwing! üé≥
Now, with a simple trigger press, we can grab the ball, aim, and throw it towards the bowling pins! The physics engine takes over, making the throw feel realistic and satisfying.
