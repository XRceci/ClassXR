# XR Lab Week 2 - Roll-A-Ball

This week, we developed a small VR program using Meta Quest and Unity. Our goal was to build a simple bowling game to test ball interactions in VR. Below are the steps we followed:

## Step 1: Unity Setup

To develop for Oculus Quest, we started by installing the **XR Interaction Toolkit**, which is essential for VR game development. From the XR Plug-in Management window in Project Settings, we selected Oculus as the platform for Android standalone devices. We also installed the Meta All-in-One package to enable various interactions.

## Step 2: Adding XR Rig

We created an empty GameObject and added an XR Rig component to it. Then, we assigned the appropriate game objects to the **Camera Floor Object Offset** and the **Camera Game Object** in the XR Rig. We set the **Tracking Origin Mode** to "Floor" to avoid the camera starting at floor level.

## Step 3: Adding Controllers

We added both hand controllers and attached the **XR Controller** component to them.

## Step 4: Building the Scene

To prototype, we:
- Added a Plane object to the scene.
- Created a cube as a table.
- Added a ball, which could be grasped with the hand controllers.
- Placed some bowling pins, which could be knocked over by the ball.

## Step 5: XR Interactable Objects

We added additional components to enable interaction with the objects.

## Step 6: Modifications

### Retry Feature

Instead of using simple sphere objects and cylinders as pins, we searched for more realistic assets. We found [this free bowling pack](https://deplorablemountaineer.itch.io/bowling-ball-and-pins) on itch.io, which includes `.fbx` models that we added to the scene as game objects.

To allow the user multiple attempts when throwing a ball, we wrote a script to reset the bowling pins 10 seconds after a ball is thrown. This was achieved by saving the initial positions of the pins.

### Skybox

To create a more "relaxing" atmosphere, we added a skybox found on itch.io. This was done by navigating to **Window > Rendering > Lighting Settings**, and in the **Environment** tab, assigning the new skybox material.
