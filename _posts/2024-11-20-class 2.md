## Roll-A-Ball -1 

This week, we developed a small VR program using Meta Quest and Unity. Our goal was to build a simple bowling game to test ball interactions in VR. Below are the steps we followed:

### Step 1:Adding Controllers
We added both hand controllers and attached the XR Controller component to them.

### Step 2: Building the Scene
To prototype, we:
- Added a Plane object to the scene.
- Created a cube as a table.
- Added a ball, which could be grasped with the hand controllers.
- Placed some bowling pins, which could be knocked over by the ball.

### Step 3: tep 3: Making Objects Interactive 
To bring our VR world to life, we made objects interactable!
####  Adding Physics 
We attached a Rigidbody to the ball, allowing it to react to gravity and collisions.

####  Enabling VR Interaction 🖐️
We added the XR Grab Interactable component, so the ball could be picked up and manipulated in VR.

####  Grabbing & Throwing! 🎳
Now, with a simple trigger press, we can grab the ball, aim, and throw it towards the bowling pins! The physics engine takes over, making the throw feel realistic and satisfying.

### Step 4:Enhancing the Experience 🎳

Instead of using simple spheres and cylinders for the bowling setup, we searched for more realistic assets. We found a free bowling pack on itch.io that included high-quality .fbx models. After importing them into our scene as game objects, our VR bowling experience instantly became more immersive and visually appealing!

### Step 5: Resetting Pins for Multiple Attempts 🎳

To let users enjoy multiple throws, we created a script that resets the bowling pins 10 seconds after the ball is thrown. This works by saving the initial positions of the pins and restoring them after each attempt, keeping the gameplay smooth and fun!

### Step 6: Adding a Relaxing Skybox 

To enhance the atmosphere, we added a skybox from itch.io. By going to Window > Rendering > Lighting Settings and assigning the skybox material in the Environment tab, we gave the scene a more calming and immersive vibe. Now it's not just fun, but relaxing too! 🎮✨
