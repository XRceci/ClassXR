Presence in Virtual Reality

```
Presence: The subjective experience of being in a virtual environment even when physically located elsewhere. It is distinct from immersion, which refers to how technology generates an illusion of reality.
Immersion: The degree to which a technology can deliver a vivid illusion of reality to human senses. This often leads to a sense of presence in the virtual environment.
Measuring Presence: Presence is often measured subjectively (through questionnaires) or physiologically (via changes in heart rate or skin conductance).
```


Factors Influencing Presence

```
Vividness: Rich sensory experiences.
Interactivity: The extent to which users can interact with the virtual environment.
User Differences: Individual factors like experience and personality impact presence.
Realism and Sensory Feedback: How realistic the environment feels through sensory inputs like sight, sound, and touch.
```


Challenges in VR Sensory Simulation
```
Sensory Conflict Theory: Occurs when sensory inputs (e.g., visual and vestibular) provide conflicting information, leading to simulator sickness.
Haptic Perception: While the sense of touch is important for interaction in VR, it is currently underutilized in most consumer devices.
```

VR Technology Components
```
Display: The primary component, typically involving head-mounted displays (HMDs) that simulate visual experiences.
Tracking: Used to track user position and movement within the virtual environment.
Input Devices: Allow user interaction with the environment (e.g., controllers, hand tracking).
Processing: Handles rendering and processing of VR environments.
