# XR Lab 3
## XR Lab Week 2 - Roll-A-Ball

This week, we developed a small VR program using Meta Quest and Unity. Our goal was to build a simple bowling game to test ball interactions in VR. Below are the steps we followed:

### Step 1: Unity Setup
To develop for Oculus Quest, we started by installing the XR Interaction Toolkit, which is essential for VR game development. From the XR Plug-in Management window in Project Settings, we selected Oculus as the platform for Android standalone devices. We also installed the Meta All-in-One package to enable various interactions.

### Step 2: Adding XR Rig
We created an empty GameObject and added an XR Rig component to it. Then, we assigned the appropriate game objects to the Camera Floor Object Offset and the Camera Game Object in the XR Rig. We set the Tracking Origin Mode to "Floor" to avoid the camera starting at floor level.

### Step 3: Adding Controllers
We added both hand controllers and attached the XR Controller component to them.

### Step 4: Building the Scene
To prototype, we:
- Added a Plane object to the scene.
- Created a cube as a table.
- Added a ball, which could be grasped with the hand controllers.
- Placed some bowling pins, which could be knocked over by the ball.

### Step 5: XR Interactable Objects
We added additional components to enable interaction with the objects.

### Step 6: Modifications
#### Retry Feature
Instead of using simple sphere objects and cylinders as pins, we searched for more realistic assets. We found this free bowling pack on itch.io, which includes .fbx models that we added to the scene as game objects.

To allow the user multiple attempts when throwing a ball, we wrote a script to reset the bowling pins 10 seconds after a ball is thrown. This was achieved by saving the initial positions of the pins.

#### Skybox
To create a more "relaxing" atmosphere, we added a skybox found on itch.io. This was done by navigating to Window > Rendering > Lighting Settings, and in the Environment tab, assigning the new skybox material.
