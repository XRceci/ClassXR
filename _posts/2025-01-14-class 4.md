##  Selecting projects in a supermarket
This week, we explored two methods for selecting objects in a virtual supermarket. Here's what we came up with:

## FlyRing Selection
Our first idea is called FlyRing Selection. Inspired by the dynamic and immersive gameplay of Beat Saber, we wanted to create something equally impressive and fancy. Initially, objects dramatically fly toward the user from far away. While visually stunning, we realized it might be overwhelming, so we refined the interaction to be more practical.

Here's how it works:

1. Selecting a Cluster:
Using Raycast, the user selects a cluster of objects on a distant shelf. The cluster is highlighted and begins to gracefully move toward the user.

2. Cluster Expansion:
Once the cluster arrives in front of the user, it expands into individual items, ready for selection.

3. Circular Arrangement:
The items are arranged in a neat circular pattern around the user, making it intuitive and easy to browse.

4. Focus on a Specific Item:
When the user selects a specific item, it moves to the center of the display, becoming the primary focus for detailed interaction.

## Arrow-Guided Precision Selection

Our second method focuses on precision. This interaction is designed for users who want to pick a specific item accurately and efficiently.
Here’s how it works:
    Visual Indicators:
    Each object is assigned a unique visual indicator, helping the user identify items quickly.

2. Region Selection:
The user points their controller at the general region where the desired item is located.

3. Directional Arrows:
Arrows appear above the objects, guiding the user’s movement to the specific item. This step helps refine the selection process.

4. Interactive Matching:
The user matches the movement of their controller to the direction of the arrows, locking in on the desired object.

These two methods showcase the potential of VR to reimagine object selection in a supermarket setting. It's the visually striking FlyRing Selection while the Arrow-Guided Precision Selection is highly accurate.
