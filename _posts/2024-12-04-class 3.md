## Roll-A-Ball- 2

This week, we took our VR program to the next level by integrating hand interactions and making the experience feel even more immersive. Here's what we did:

### Step 1:Integrating Hand Presence 🖐️

First, we created the hand presence system to track the user's hand movements in VR.
We confirmed it was working perfectly by checking the console logs for real-time updates.

Next, we set up the controller prefab, ensuring it was visible in the scene. This gave the user a clear representation of their hands in the VR world.

Finally, we imported hand models and used a hand presence script to synchronize the rotation and position of the controller with the hand model. Now, the hands look and feel realistic as they move naturally in VR.

### Step 2:Enhancing the Experience 🎳

Instead of using simple spheres and cylinders for the bowling setup, we searched for more realistic assets. We found a free bowling pack on itch.io that included high-quality .fbx models. After importing them into our scene as game objects, our VR bowling experience instantly became more immersive and visually appealing!

### Step 3: Resetting Pins for Multiple Attempts 🎳

To let users enjoy multiple throws, we created a script that resets the bowling pins 10 seconds after the ball is thrown. This works by saving the initial positions of the pins and restoring them after each attempt, keeping the gameplay smooth and fun!

### Step 4: Adding a Relaxing Skybox 

To enhance the atmosphere, we added a skybox from itch.io. By going to Window > Rendering > Lighting Settings and assigning the skybox material in the Environment tab, we gave the scene a more calming and immersive vibe. Now it's not just fun, but relaxing too! 🎮✨
